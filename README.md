#### A Model of Quadrotor Power Consumption and Its Performance Across a Range of Flight Conditions
##### Submitted to RA-L and ICRA 2020
**_Abstract_** — In this paper, we present a parametric model of quadrotor power consumption and characterize the per- formance of this model in hardware experiments. Like other existing power models that have been used both for quadrotors and general rotorcraft, ours can be expressed as the sum of four terms—induced, parasitic, profile, and climb power—that depend on estimates of the aerodynamic forces and moments acting on the quadrotor. We measure the accuracy of our full model across a wide range of flight conditions and also conduct an ablation study to show the relative contribution of each term, concluding that this contribution strongly depends on the ground velocity of the quadrotor. Both our dataset and code are freely available as a benchmark to facilitate future work in this area.
