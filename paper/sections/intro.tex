 
The last decade has seen quadrotor helicopters explode in popularity. From an emerging unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) concept to a prominent research and commercial platform \cite{kumar2012opportunities,hoffmann2007quadrotor} quadrotors have become the nearly ubiquitous aerial robot. Their relative low cost and the simplicity of their dynamics when near hover \cite{bouabdallah2004pid} has made them popular in numerous applications \cite{heng2015efficient,roberts2017submodular,frazzoli2002real}. No matter the application, if the quadrotor is autonomous, all its motion is occurring near hover.

The condition of operating near hover also introduces the quadrotor platform's greatest weakness, power efficiency. In \cite{kumar2012opportunities} Kumar et al. state that the power required for a quadrotor to maintain hover is approximately 200 W per kg. Additionally, due to current LiPo battery technology a quadrotor's battery can be 25-30\% of its total mass. These two consequences create a practical limit on quadrotor utility. This limit restricts the size of an area that can be explored, the number of images that can be captured by a camera, the mass of potential payloads, etc..

In robotics, maximizing endurance is mostly thought of as a design problem handled by manufacturers. In this paper we present evidence that choices about trajectory and velocity also have a meaningful effect on flight time.

Determining an aerial vehicle's endurance is a common problem in flight mechanics. Solutions for fixed wing and rotor aircraft maximum endurance in steady, forward flight are well known and widely used \cite{anderson2005introduction,leishman2006principles}. Maximum endurance is achieved by traveling at the relative velocity, $V_\infty$, where the power required, $P_{req}$, to overcome the drag force, $D$, is at a minimum. We call this velocity $V_{me}$.
