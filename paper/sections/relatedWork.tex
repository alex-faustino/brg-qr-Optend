\subsection{Rotorcraft Flight Mechanics}
The bulk of our work is supported by the momentum analysis methods derived by \cite{leishman2006principles}. These methods provide closed form, non-dimensional expressions for a rotorcraft's power required to maintain straight level flight \eqref{nondLevelFlightEqn} (excluding the unnecessary term for tail rotor power) and power required to maintain a constant, level turn \eqref{nondConstTurnEqn} where $\phi$ is the bank angle.

\begin{equation}
    \label{nondLevelFlightEqn}
    P_{req} = \frac{k C_W^2}{2\sqrt{\lambda^2+\mu^2}}+\frac{\sigma C_{d_0}}{8}(1+K \mu^2)+\frac{1}{2}(\frac{f}{A})\mu^3+\lambda_c C_W
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
    \label{nondConstTurnEqn}
    C_P = \frac{k(\frac{C_W}{cos\phi})^2}{2\sqrt{\lambda^2+\mu^2}}+\frac{\sigma C_{d_0}}{8}(1+K \mu^2)+\frac{1}{2}(\frac{f}{A})\mu^3+\lambda_c C_W
\end{equation}
We simplify equations \ref{nondLevelFlightEqn} and \ref{nondConstTurnEqn} to dimensioned versions specific to our quadrotor using empirical values for $K$ and $k$. \textbf{NEED TO VERIFY THAT THESE HOLD AT SCALE}. These equations are covered in more detail in Section \ref{flightMechSec}.

\subsection{Drone Trajectory Optimization and Control}
Biggest difference between the majority of quadrotor work is that wind is treated as a disturbance that needs to be rejected\cite{waslander2009wind}. Our work lays the foundation for using wind disturbance as an "energy source" similar to autonomous water vehicles.

\subsection{Dynamic Soaring}
In similar spirit to our work is the climbing strategies proposed by \cite{zhao2017optimal}. They propose exploiting certain wind conditions to improve the efficiency of rotor vehicles most inefficient maneuver. Combined with our work the majority of common quadrotor mission trajectories can be created piece-wise efficiently.
