	Determining an aircraft's velocity that maximizes its range or endurance is a long solved problem in aerodynamics and flight mechanics. However, due to the dynamic limitations of quadrotors a decade ago these solutions have been widely ignored in robotic applications. We present experimental validation that incorporating solutions derived from momentum analysis can increase a quadrotor's endurance by as much as 20\%. We focus on quadrotors with a camera payload and demonstrate the advantages of orbiting a point-of-interest rather than hovering above it.
