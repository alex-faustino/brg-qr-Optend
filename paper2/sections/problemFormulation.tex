In this section we show how given two points in SE(3) $q_i$, $q_f$; physical properties $I_B$, $m$; aerodynamic constants $\mu_1$, $\mu_2$, $\kappa$; and a known time varying wind field $v_w\left(t\text{, }x\text{, }y\text{, }z\right)$ we find a power optimal trajectory by solving

\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
	\min_{v_\infty} \quad & \sum\limits_{t=i}^{f}\kappa T \left(v_i + v_\infty^B|_z \right) + \dot{q}^W_z m \|g\| \\
	\textrm{s.t.} \quad & v_\infty = \dot{q}^W_B - v_w
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}

From \eqref{PowReqEqn} we can see that choosing $v_\infty$ as our decision variable is the most practical solution 
% linearize around constant velocity
% minimize $P_req$ with $\dot{q}^W$ as decision variable  with fixed initial state, fixed final state and, free final time
% check for feasibility of trajectory
