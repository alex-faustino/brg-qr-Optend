	A problem that continues to persist for quadrotor UAVs is their low endurance relative to other prominent UAV platforms. There exist three main approaches to solving this problem: improving hardware efficiency, designing new hybrid systems, and developing software solutions that focus on optimal planning and control. Of the three, software solutions have received the least attention. Existing methods are either heavily constrained, challenging to implement on physical systems, or require significant off-line computation. In this paper we present a method for finding power minimal, smooth trajectories for a quadrotor in SE(3) using exiting models for power and energy consumption. We show that the problem can be formulated as a constrained, continuous time optimal control problem with a polynomial cost function that can be solved numerically. Through simulation we show that our approach, when compared to existing methods, reduces total energy consumption by \textbf{INSERT RESULTS HERE}\% on average.
